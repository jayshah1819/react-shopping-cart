Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive guide and workflow for building a fully functional shopping cart application using React, Node.js, and Redux. It has a range of features and technologies aimed at creating a better shopping experience. The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of development, from setting up the environment to deploying the website.

Key Features:

	Fully-Functional Shopping Cart: The application provides a complete shopping cart experience, allowing users to add and remove items, view their cart, and proceed to checkout.

Instant Feedback: Users receive instant feedback through animated interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Animated and Intuitive Design: The design of the application incorporates animations to make the user interface more engaging and intuitive.

Product Listing: The app displays a list of products with details like title, image, and price, providing a clear overview of available items.

Sorting and Filtering: Users can sort products by price (high to low or low to high) and filter them by size, making it easier to find specific items.

Product Details Modal: Clicking on a product opens a modal displaying detailed information about the selected item.

	User-Friendly Checkout Form: The application includes a user-friendly checkout form where users can provide their email, name, and address for order processing.

Order Management: The project incorporates a feature to create orders with user-friendly IDs, facilitating efficient order tracking and management.

Admin Section: An admin section allows for the management of products, providing an interface to view and manipulate the product list.

	API Interaction with Postman: The application demonstrates how to interact with APIs using Postman, enabling the addition and removal of products and orders.
Tools and Technologies:

JavaScript (ES6 features like arrow functions, spread operators, etc.)
React (including react-router-dom, react-reveal, and react-modal)
Redux (with react-redux and redux-thunk for state management)
Node.js (utilizing express, body-parser, environment variables, and nodemon)
MongoDB (with mongoose and shortid for database operations)
VS Code (with useful extensions like ES6 Snippets, ES7 React Extension, ESLint Extension, CSS Peek)
Chrome DevTools (utilizing React Developer Tools and Redux Developer Tools for debugging)
Git (covering repo creation, committing, pushing to remote, and branching)
GitHub (including repo creation, linking to local repo, pull requests, and merging)
Postman (demonstrating GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to APIs)
Deployment on Heroku and MongoDB Atlas Cloud for hosting the application.
Development Workflow:
The project follows a structured development workflow, including steps for creating, managing, and deploying features using Git and GitHub.
